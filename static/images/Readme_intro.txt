'You wake up in a dark place. Your eyes slowly adjust, and you see a dagger next to you. While you're picking it up,
you suddenly hear something coming from the darkness! You're still trying to understand what happened the night before when...'

In this game the Hero has to escape a multiple room dungeon. But his skills will be hard tested by a series of fights along his journey towards the light!
To help our protagonist in his quest we will have the chance to improve our armour and our weapons as well as our skills...
But don't be deceived by this! Your journey will still be long and full of blood!!!
